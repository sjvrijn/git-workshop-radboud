A poem on honeybees:

In gardens bright, where flowers sway,  
Honeybees buzz the livelong day.  
With waggle dances, they show the way,  
To the sweetest blooms where they love to play.

A queen so busy, laying eggs galore,  
Two thousand daily—who could ask for more?  
Running her hive like a bustling store,  
A royal mom, she’s never a bore!

The worker bees, like bouncers keen,  
Check IDs at the hive's big scene.  
If you’re not family, you won't get in,  
They keep the hive safe with a little spin.

Honey, oh honey, forever it stays,  
Found in tombs from ancient days.  
Three thousand years, it still plays,  
A timeless treat that never decays!

With eyes that see in ultraviolet light,  
They spot flower patterns, a true delight.  
Buzzing around like a tiny flight,  
A fuzzy motorcycle in full flight!

In hives so social, they laugh and tease,  
Eighty thousand strong, the ultimate bees.  
With drama and gossip carried on the breeze,  
They live life sweetly, doing just as they please.

But beware the duel when queens arise,  
A battle ensues, a fight to the prize.  
In the hive of life, with all its ties,  
Honeybees thrive beneath sunny skies!
